I'm a master student majored in Ecology at UCAS (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences) and IUE (Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences), where I study and explore urban ecology, deep learning, remote sensing, etc. I am supervised by Profs. Quanyi Qiu and Lina Tang. By studying artificial intelligence and remote sensing technology, I hope I can solve urban ecological problems and contribute to humanity.
