	abstract = {Previously published studies on population distribution were based on the provincial level, while the number of urban-level studies is more limited. In addition, the rough spatial resolution of traditional nighttime light (NTL) data has limited their fine application in current small-scale population distribution research. For the purpose of studying the spatial distribution of populations at the urban scale, we proposed a new index (i.e., the road network adjusted human settlement index, RNAHSI) by integrating Luojia 1-01 (LJ 1-01) NTL data, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and road network density (RND) data based on population density relationships to depict the spatial distribution of urban human settlements. The RNAHSI updated the high-resolution NTL data and combined the RND data on the basis of human settlement index (HSI) data to refine the spatial pattern of urban population distribution. The results indicated that the mean relative error (MRE) between the population estimation data based on the RNAHSI and the demographic data was 34.80\%, which was lower than that in the HSI and WorldPop dataset. This index is suitable primarily for the study of urban population distribution, as the RNAHSI can clearly highlight human activities in areas with dense urban road networks and can refine the spatial heterogeneity of impervious areas. In addition, we also drew a population density map of the city of Shenzhen with a 100 m spatial resolution for 2018 based on the RNAHSI, which has great reference significance for urban management and urban resource allocation.},

	abstract = {Land-use planning and design (LPD) is one of the most critical passways toward sustainable development. LPD without thorough considerations can cause many problems, such as disharmony between people’s perception and nature, the chaos of spatial patterns, and the misuse of land resources. Landsenses ecology, a discipline based on natural elements and people’s perception, provide scientific basis to guide LPD. Here we summarized the state-of-the-art concept of optimal visual perception based on conventional optical theory and contemporary visualization technology. Instead of solely using an artistic design perspective to sum up experience, we combined human binocular visual angle and distance with the field of view (FOV) of cell phone cameras to determine an optimal visual perception. We explained the rationality of the concept of optimal visual perception with three examples, located at the Institute of Urban Environmental (IUE) from Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Welcoming-Guests Pine on Huangshan Mountain, and the Sunlight Rock of Gulangyu Island in Xiamen, China, respectively. Both landsenses involving the IUE and Welcoming-Guests Pine satisfy the required conditions for optimal visual perception, whereas the Sunlight Rock shows the chaos of near and far landscapes, which is not compatible with the optimal visual perception. At the end of this paper, we provide pieces of advice on applying optimal visual perception to land-use planners and architects as well as sustainability scholars.},

	abstract = {The timely and accurate recognition of damage to buildings after destructive disasters is one of the most important post-event responses. Due to the complex and dangerous situations in affected areas, field surveys of post-disaster conditions are not always feasible. The use of satellite imagery for disaster assessment can overcome this problem. However, the textural and contextual features of post-event satellite images vary with disaster types, which makes it difficult to use models that have been developed for a specific disaster type to detect damaged buildings following other types of disasters. Therefore, it is hard to use a single model to effectively and automatically recognize post-disaster building damage for a broad range of disaster types. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a building damage detection network ({BDD}-Net) composed of a novel end-to-end remote sensing pixel-classification deep convolutional neural network. {BDD}-Net was developed to automatically classify every pixel of a post-disaster image into one of non-damaged building, damaged building, or background classes. Pre- and post-disaster images were provided as input for the network to increase semantic information, and a hybrid loss function that combines dice loss and focal loss was used to optimize the network. Publicly available data were utilized to train and test the model, which makes the presented method readily repeatable and comparable. The protocol was tested on images for five disaster types, namely flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, and wildfire. The results show that the proposed method is consistently effective for recognizing buildings damaged by different disasters and in different areas.},

	abstract = {Information about urban built-up areas is important for urban planning and management. However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification ({BAIC}) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the {BAIC} were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the {BAIC} to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest ({POI}), Road Network ({RN}), nighttime light ({NTL}), a combination of {POI} and {RN} data ({POI}\_RN), a combination of {POI} and {NTL} data ({POI}\_NTL), a combination of {RN} and {NTL} data ({RN}\_NTL), and a combination of {POI}, {RN}, and {NTL} data ({POI}\_RN\_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression ({LR}), Decision Tree ({DT}), Random Forests ({RF}), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees ({GBDT}), and {AdaBoost}. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy ({OA}) ranged from 76 to 89\%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve ({AUC}) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. The largest F1 value and {OA} were obtained using the {POI}\_RN\_NTL data and {AdaBoost}, while the largest {AUC} was obtained using {POI}\_RN\_NTL and {POI}\_NTL data against {AdaBoost}, {LR}, and {RF}; and (2) the advantages of the {BAIC} include its support for multi-source input data, its objective accuracy assessment, and its robust classifiers. The {BAIC} can quickly and efficiently realize the automatic classification of urban built-up areas at a reasonably low cost and can be readily applied to other urban areas in the world where any kind of {POI}, {RN}, or {NTL} data coverage is available. The results of this study are expected to provide timely and effective reference information for urban planning and urban management departments, and could also potentially be used to develop large-scale maps of urban built-up areas in the future.},
